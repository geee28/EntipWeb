Many a times we find ourselves in group events and end up scrolling on OTT platforms deciding a movie that most of the members in the group might enjoy. 
This leads to a lot of wastage of time, and thus a higher need of a group recommendation system. Group recommendation systems are currently a blowing research topic, and this is an attempt to solve the problem.

The motivation stemmed from the multiple hours our friends spent only looking for something to watch, instead of watching something.
